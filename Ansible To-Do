#General info: This to-do list is by no means comprehensive, and will change as the environment is added to. 

Goals:
- Roll out scoped configuration management of switch hosts (i.e configure pillars of switch configuration using Ansible.)
- Figure out how to use Jinja2 for templatizing config.
- Schedule playbooks using cron jobs.
- Integrate with Netbox.
