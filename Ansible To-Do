#General info: This to-do list is by no means comprehensive, and will change as the environment is added to. 

Goals:
- Add more hosts to lab
- Roll out scoped configuration management of switch hosts (i.e configure pillars of switch configuration using Ansible.)
- Render a Jinja2 template on switch hosts. 
- Use Jinja2 template to enforce configuration management.
